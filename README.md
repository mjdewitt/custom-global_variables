# custom-global_variables
this is a fork of newtarget.com's plugin version 1.1.2

The fundamental difference is that this version handles zero values, nulls, and booleans.

The display of both variable names and values has been expanded

Variable names must be proper and unique before submitting

the value field type toggles between text and texarea when the string length is greater than 50

errors are displayed before submit

submit is disabled by errors

user documentation of variable handling is added and can be displayed optionally

a dump of $GLOBALS['cgv'] may be optionally displayed
